% ORTHONORMAL_BASIS creates an orthonormal basis from a pure quaternion V,

% The result is represented as a 3 by 3 orthogonal matrix, which may be
% complex if V and/or W are complex pure quaternions.

% TODO: Consider an alternative method based on rotation of the standard
% basis. Given V, compute a rotation that rotates qi to V. Apply the same
% rotation to qj and qk, and you have a new basis which is bound to be
% orthogonal. The role of W in this needs to be thought out. Do we really
% need it? There are two ways to compute the rotation from V to qi. One is
% to rotate around the axis perpendicular to the plane containing V and qi.
% This is easily done by computing q = scalar_product(V, qi) +
% vector_product(V, qi), then p = exp(axis(q).*angle(q)./2). The rotation
% is then conj(p).*qi.p to get V, and similarly with qj and qk to get the
% other two axes. The second method is to rotate through pi about the axis
% in the plane mid-way between V and qi. This is mu = unit(V + qi). Then
% the rotations are computed by the involution -mu.*qi.mu, etc. This is
% simpler and possibly more accurate as it does not involve computing an
% angle or exponential. See the file orthonormal.m for a reference to be
% included here if either of these methods are used (Mackenzie and
% Thomson).
