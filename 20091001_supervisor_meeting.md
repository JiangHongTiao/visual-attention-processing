# Introduction #

  * Discuss about the project topics over three years
  * Discuss about the simulation, implementation, and improvement of the still image saliency

# Details #

## Original plan ##

  * **Still image saliency - year 1**
  * **Multiple image saliency - year 2**
  * **Hardware Implementation - year 3**

## Modified plan ##

### Year 1 ###

  * **Still image saliency** from 10/2009 to 01/2010
  * **Multiple image saliency** from 02/2010 to 05/2010
  * **Hardware Implementation** from 06/2010 to 10/2010

### The continuous task ###

Doing literature review for

  * **Still image saliency**
  * **Multiple image saliency**
  * **Hardware Implementation**

Note: Reading about standards and think about how you can improve it in my thesis.

### The specific task ###

Doing research on still image saliency

  * **Research and find** _regioned based (watershed)_ saliency method
  * **Simulate** this method by _MATLAB / Octave_ and show the improvement
  * **Implement** this _improved method_
