Static images ==============> Orientation Map ========> Maps ============> Attention Maps
                              Flicker Map
                              Color Map
                              Intensity

  * Applications:
    1. Lane Tracking
    1. Sign board
    1. Vehicle lecturer
    1. Pedestrian lecturer
  * Notes:
    1. Don't touch Itti code
    1. Tune Itti output maps such as orientation maps, flicker maps
    1. Compare between simulation results with / without tuning
  * Interesting Paper
    1. Towards a Proactive Biologically-inspired Advanced Driver Assistance System [paper](http://visual-attention-processing.googlecode.com/files/Towards%20a%20Proactive%20Biologically-inspired%20Advanced%20Driver%20Assistance%20System.pdf)
  * Database
    1. Need to find passenger and pedestrian video database
## DSP Application Review ##

## Working Plan for 3,4,5 / 11 / 2009 ##

  1. Read and Summarize the paper "Towards a Proactive Biologically-inspired Advanced Driver Assistance System"
  1. Carry on Experiment 3
