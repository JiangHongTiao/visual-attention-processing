# Digital Vision Chip/System for Bio-Inspired Visual Attention Processing #

Visual attention research is concerned with which elements of a visual scene are likely to attract the attention of human observers. This is in contrast to research in traditional image processing which scans the visual scene looking for specific objects (e.g. people, vehicles, etc) that it has been trained to look for. Thus a system trained to look for people would not be able to detect vehicles and vice-versa. A system based on visual attention processing would be able to detect both people and vehicles and also other objects that are likely to attract the attention of human observers without the need for prior training. This has advantages, for example, in a driver assistance system when the system is able to detect a fallen tree on the road (even though the system has not been previously trained to look for trees) and alerts the driver. This project will also develop a vision chip/system prototype for bio-inspired processing which has commercial potential for applications in security, automotive, manufacturing and multimedia.

# Objectives of the research project #

  * Develop new visual attention models by incorporating context information/prior knowledge and motion/depth information.

  * Implement a hardware digital vision chip/system for bio-inspired visual attention processing.

  * Establish a new inter-campus research link between VIER and VIP by leveraging on their respective strengths on a jointly supervised PhD project.

# Timeline #
