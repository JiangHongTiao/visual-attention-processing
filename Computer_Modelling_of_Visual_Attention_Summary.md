Five important trends of computational models of visual attention that emphasizes on "bottom-up and image based control of attentional deployment"
  * The perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on surrounding environments
  * A unique ‘saliency map’ that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity
  * Inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again
  * Attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention.
  * Scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations
