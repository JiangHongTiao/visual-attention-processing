== General Ideas ==

 # Bottom-up search approach
 # Artificial Intelligent / Neural Network f
 # Top-down searching approach 

== Specific Ideas for visual saliency improvment ==

 * Integrating shape-saliency map by Fourier descriptor into the bottom-search algorithms
 * Problems: 
  * Shape-saliency map is constructed by pixel-based image processing techniques

== Supervisor suggestion ==

 * Extending the lane & vehicle detection by saliency-based segmentation techniques
 * Comparing the result with and without the implementation of segmentation techniques
