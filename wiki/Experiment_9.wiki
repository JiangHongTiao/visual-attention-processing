Redo the experiment described in [Fixations in Faces research website http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~moran/fifadb/].

First few steps have been done to compare following saliency methods with GBVS and Itti Koch Saliency Method:

Over few experiments, the ROC results show the superior of GBVS and Itti comparing to PFT and PQFT methods.
