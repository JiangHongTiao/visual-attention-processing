== Abstract == 

 * Need to have standard measurement techniques in visual attention models
 * This paper: a review of the evaluation techniques
 * Propose new methods and metrics

== Introduction == 

 * Lack of standard metrics and methods for measuring and evaluating outcome of models
 * This paper attempts to design standard metrics for evaluation of visual attention 
 * Questions
  # Aspects of attentions (AA) Ex: evaluation of an attentive visual research, free viewing
  # Evaluation aspect (EA) Ex: comparing with natural attention or competence of specific tasks
  # Output format (OF) Ex: scanpaths or fixation spots
  # Perspective of results (PR) Ex: evaluation aspects
  # Measurement methods (MM) to extract readings 

== A Survey of Available Techniques 

 * Acceptability = number of fixation before attending targets
 * Normalized scan path salience = compare saliency map with human eyes' fixation 
 * False fixation before focusing on the place of required objects
 * Fixations and locations 
 * Examine the down-sample resolution 
 * Hybrid approach
 * Same features attended whether or not the scene are changed
 * Form of the standard distance h(A,B) = median(min||a-b||2)

== Analysis ==

 Five questions for analysis: 
  
 # AA aspects of attentions -> B (bottom-up), T (top-down), N (pathway-neutral)
 # AE aspects of evaluation -> V (validation test), C (Competence-test)
 # OF output format -> M(saliency map), F(fixation points), P(scan-path)
 # PR perspectives of results -> L (location), S (saliency magnitudes), O(order of sequence)
 # MM measurement methodology -> E (equivalence), D (feedback), R (attention mode)

== Proposed methods and metrics ==

 Range: 0 - 1 0 worst and 1 best
 Metric: measure model's performance against known number and location of targets

=== Competence test ===

 * NS ( number of embedded salient objects ) / NF ( number of object found )
 * NS (number of salient objects ) / NA (number of times until required targets are covered )

 * Compare the sequence of ROIs by humans and algorithms
 * 2 methods of temporal anaylysis head-based and time-based 
  * Head-based: locate sequence of still images
  * Time-based: duration for fixation 100ms
 
 * Score-S metric: higher score for fixation point along the scan-path

 * Evaluation by comparing saliency maps to a benchmark maps

  md = matching points 
  Nd = total compared points
  md / Nd = similarity measure in direction 
 
 * Counting the number of FOA nits and misses
 * Count = hit: if half of the targetr inside FOA; miss: otherwise
 * Completeness = undetected targets / detected targets

 * Performance of top-down search systems: 2 metrics
  * u(fixations / search ) less tries / target is more successful
  * u(search time) : shorter search time is successful
  * Metric of detection rate
  * Metric of number of attentional shifts before targets
  * Metric of erroneous fixations wrt the total number of targets

=== Validation test === 
== Sample Implementation == 
== Conclusion == 

 * A survey of existing techniques 
 * New methods are proposed that serves the purpose of advancing towards the standardization 
 * Simplicity of easiness to avoid influence of non-relevant factors
 * Standardize the shape and size of saliency spots and fixation windows
 * Standardize image size and resolutions
