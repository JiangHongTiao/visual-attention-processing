= Introduction =

This document is written to collect and organize data / information in DSP Hardware Implementation. It mainly focuses on the integration between MATLAB and CCS. The simulink model is designed in MATLAB and converted directly into C code used by CCS by Code Generation Tool, and several other CCS and MATLAB native softwares.
