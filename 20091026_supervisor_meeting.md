## General Ideas ##

  1. Bottom-up search approach
  1. Artificial Intelligent / Neural Network f
  1. Top-down searching approach

## Specific Ideas for visual saliency improvment ##

  * Integrating shape-saliency map by Fourier descriptor into the bottom-search algorithms
  * Problems:
    * Shape-saliency map is constructed by pixel-based image processing techniques

## Supervisor suggestion ##

  * Extending the lane & vehicle detection by saliency-based segmentation techniques
  * Comparing the result with and without the implementation of segmentation techniques
